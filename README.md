# YouTodo
RPG-like Task Management App

This project's goal is to make certain life-tasks fun and rewarding by giving you points.  Rewards will be self-assigned, and the UI/UX will be designed to help motivate.  It should be good for all ages, and have an account structure that allows families, and group-assigned tasks (so a parent could give a child a quest, or a child could give a parent a quest).

Additionally, there should be global quests that people can create, share, and add to their list.  A quest could be "Learn to Juggle" or "Learn to knit" and would contain a set of sub-quests that include learning materials and milestones so that progress can be tracked.

All outstanding feature requests will be created as issues, so anyone is free to look at outstanding issues and contribute.  All files will be provided for you to run your own local copy or online version of this codebase, although there will be a public one available that will run off the master codebase.
